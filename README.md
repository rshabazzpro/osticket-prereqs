I began by establishing a resource group where my virtual machine would be hosted. After creating the resource group, I proceeded to generate the virtual machine and associated it with the resource group. Finally, I completed the setup of my virtual machine.

<p>
In this step, I acquired a file named PHP containing its contents. I intend to unzip these contents into a directory I've established within the C/ directory, naming it PHP. The process involves extracting the contents from the right and transferring them into the designated directory on the left.
